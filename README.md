# Matplotlib Challenge - Pymaceuticals Inc. 

## Background: 

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

## Task:

Generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Summarry: 

- We started out with with a total of 249 mice, and were able to identify 1 duplicate. Upon excluding the duplicate, we confirm 248 unique mice and used this data to perform the following visualizations and linear regression analysis.  

- The _bar graphs_ showed us that the drug Capomulin was used the most (230 mice) and Propiva was used the least (161) 

- The _pie chart_ made it easy to visual that there is an almost even split between _female_ and _male_ mice at 49.8% and 50.2% respectively. 

- When comparing final volume and drug regimen, the _box plots_ help us see that the median final tumor volume for Capomulin and Ramicane are very similar, around 35 mm3. Similarly, Infubinol and Ceftamin were both centered around 60 mm3. We can also see that Infubinol has one potential outlier around where a final tumor volume level was recorded around 45 mm3, well below the lower outlier boundary for this specific drug. 

- The correlation analysis on the Capomulin drug regimen resulted with a correlation coefficient of approximately .84, which leads us to conclude that there is a moderately strong positive, linear relationship betweeen final tumor size and Capomulin drug regimen. 

- Our linear regression model may be a good option to project future tumor sizes specific to Capomulin.
